        <div class="row aboutme">
          <p class="Myname">My name is Ernie Vasquez. If you were to ask me at a young age if I wanted to become a software engineer I would have no clue to which you are talking about. My sudden interest in becoming a software engineer was the utmost surprising; however, I wasn’t determined to become one. It was not until my sophomore year in high school where this program called ScriptEd offered to teach me the foundations of coding. Since then I have learned a lot regarding basics from Html to learning JavaScript. What I would want to be in the future is a software engineer for the company Santa Monica Studios (Those responsible for the game God of War). I feel like the God of War team show good character. Both in their personalities and in their games. I want to join that team because they are a real community and I want to be able to join that community to produce games to all who enjoy it.  Each day I strive to learn more code to someday be part of the GOW team!
